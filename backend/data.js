Today, \nI have a special guest, my husband, Dan.  Dan:\nHello.  Vanessa:\nToday, we are going to be having a long   English conversation, because over two years ago, \nback in February 2020, we made this conversation   and millions of you loved this and said that \nit helped you to immerse yourself in English   and have a fun time. Today, we are going to be \ndoing something similar. We'll be talking about   at least 10, possibly more, topics. We'll be \ngiving our opinions and stories and ideas.  Dan:\nAnswers.  Vanessa:\nYes, whatever comes up   along the way. There will be subtitles for key \nphrases down here, but you can also click CC to   get the full subtitles so that you don't miss any \nwords. All right, are you ready to get started?  Dan:\nI'm ready.  Vanessa:\nLet's do it.   But wait, before we get started, like always, I \nhave created a free PDF worksheet for this lesson   that you can download. Never forget what you are \nabout to learn. You can click on the link in the   description to download this free PDF worksheet \ntoday, and you will have a chance to answer all   of today's questions too.\nDan:  Oo.\nVanessa:  Okay. Are you ready for question number one?\nDan:  Yes, I'm ready. What is it?\nVanessa:  All right. Question number one ...\nDan:  What is the meaning of life?\nVanessa:  Oh, that would be a good start. Topic number one \nis family. I'm going to be putting the timestamps   for all of these topics in the description, so if \nyou want to rewatch any of these sections you can   easily skip to them. My first question is about \nfamily, and that is what is an interesting fact   about your family history?\nDan:  Interesting fact. Well, I don't know too much \nabout my mom's side of the family. I know they've   been in the United States for a long time, but \nthey just didn't really keep any records. On my   dad's side, on the other hand, I have a, well, I \nhad a particularly detail-oriented grandmother who   would remember everything about her childhood. She \nwent back and looked at, I don't even know how she   found documents about where they came from. Her \nfamily was in Germany, near, I can't remember,   I think it's Hamburg, Hamburg. Grandpa was also \nfrom somewhere in Germany, and both of them   just happened to move to eastern Kansas, which \nis if you've ever been to Kansas, it's just corn   fields and that's it. It's not a very beautiful \nplace, but somehow they ended up in Kansas.  Dan:\nMy grandma would always give lots of details   about growing up there on the farm and how they \ndidn't have electricity. She would go on about   these stories about, this is how she would \ntalk, one time, me and my brother Bern,   we went to the backyard and filled up \nthe tin bucket with hot boiling water,   and he took all the hot water, Daniel.\nVanessa:  She remembered it was a tin bucket.\nDan:  Yeah, and it was cousin Bern, and it \nwas Uncle Freddie, people like that.   I think her father's name was Freddie.\nVanessa:  Oh, that's her son's name.\nDan:  Yeah. I don't know how interesting \nthat is, but it's the only   cultural knowledge I have about my past. The \nother side of the family, they just, we lived   in Virginia a long time ago, and my great \ngrandfather was a coal miner apparently so   kind of interesting, I guess.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I think that's pretty cool though that \nbecause in the US everyone has heritage from   other places around the world and it gets lost \nsometimes. In fact, that's what I was going to   talk about too in a moment. That area in Kansas, \nI remember your grandma saying that there were   German-only churches.\nDan:  Oh yeah.\nVanessa:  So they would speak only German. \nDid your grandma know any German?  Dan:\nVery little. I don't think she knew a lot.  Vanessa:\nI think that's kind of the generational thing,   like her parents knew it.\nDan:  She's probably the last generation that spoke \nGerman, or her parents were the last generation   that spoke German.\nVanessa:  Yeah, but then for her she just understood \nprobably some German. That community was,   for some reason, where lots of German people \nmoved to and that's where your family's from.  Dan:\nYeah. They went through a lot of   really challenging cultural changes. There was a \nlot of German mistrust and hate during that time,   obviously, for reasons that we can understand.\nVanessa:  Political reasons.\nDan:  We were at war with Germany a lot, so I think \nthey were trying to scrub out a lot of the super   German sounding things. Apparently our last \nname was more German sounding at one point.   I don't know how they said it, and speaking \nGerman would certainly be one of those things.  Vanessa:\nYeah, so they tried to assimilate to   life and that's similar to my ...\nDan:  Tell me about your family history.\nVanessa:  ...similar to the interesting point I wanted \nto tell you about. My family history is that   on my dad's side, my great \ngrandma and my great grandpa, they   are from around the area of Naples, Italy. \nFirst, my great grandpa went on a boat,   came to the US, married someone, had three kids.\nDan:  It was a good story.\nVanessa:  Then his wife died.\nDan:  Oh, that's the bad part.\nVanessa:  He had three kids and no wife and he's working, \nI'm sure, a really difficult job. That was not a   time when you could be a single father.\nDan:  This was in Pittsburgh, right?\nVanessa:  They were either in New York or Pittsburgh, \nbut by the time my great grandma came, they   went to Pittsburgh. We're getting a little ahead \nof ourselves. He wrote a letter to his mother who   lived back in Italy, and he said, I need to find \na new wife. Can you help me to find a new wife   from our hometown that will come here to live \nwith me and help take care of my three kids.   His mom said, no problem. I'll find you a wife. I \ngot her. Here's her height. Here's her dimensions.   Get a wedding dress for her. My great grandpa got \na wedding dress made in the US, the right size and   everything for his future mysterious wife. We call \nthis a mail order bride. He basically ordered her   in a letter like you would a package.\nVanessa:  I don't know what he did with his kids, \nbut he went to Italy, and as legend has it,   one day he was in the house. They \nwere preparing things for the wedding,   and he looked out the window and a woman walked \nby, and he said, oh, that's the woman I want   to marry.\nDan:  Who is that?\nVanessa:  Was that his mail order bride? \nNope, that was my great-grandmother.  Dan:\nWas it her sister? The original woman's sister?  Vanessa:\nOne of the legends is that   it was his, well not his sister ...\nDan:  Adds to the drama.\nVanessa:  But my grandma clarified. This was her mother. \nShe said, oh, he saw her outside the window.  Dan:\nJust a random lady?  Vanessa:\nUh-huh. Well, this is all a little vague   because this is going back quite some time.\nDan:  Excuse me, ma'am? Will you marry me??\nVanessa:  Basically. She was taller than his other \nsupposed to be wife. He married her. Her name   was Antoinette. He married her. She said, yes, I'm \ngoing to move to the US with you, leave my family.   She must have had a really tough situation, I \nimagine. They were all farmers. I'm sure that   was a really hard life, and that could give her \nsome hope for the future. In the wedding pictures,   her dress is a little bit too short because \nit was not supposed to be her dress. It was   supposed to be the other lady's dress. \nI'm glad that happened because otherwise   I would not be here.\nDan:  That's Vanessa's origin story, really.\nVanessa:  Yeah. This lady, Antoinette, she moved to the \nUS. She had three kids and then her husband died,   so she had six children in a new country. Crazy \nstory. She raised them. She's what we might call   the matriarch of my dad's side of the family.\nDan:  Antoinette Manolfi.\nVanessa:  Everybody who is from that side of the \nfamily knows her and reveres her. Oh,   she was so amazing. Oh yeah, she just helped \nus survive. We might say she was a survivor.   She really went through a lot, and she \nwas the right person for the job because   she made it work.\nDan:  Nice.\nVanessa:  Yeah. That's an interesting story about \nmy family. I'm sure everyone has those   as well. I want to ask you the same \nquestion. Let us know in the comments,   what's an interesting story or an interesting \nfact about your family history. We'd love to know.   Let's go to question number two. This is about \nchildhood. I'd like to know what's something that   you did as a child that you still do now. These \nare kind of personal questions to start off with.  Dan:\nWell, we laughed before   this because she said everything. I am a little \nbit, let's just say, youthful in my approach   to life. That's the positive way to say it anyway. \nSomething that I directly do, especially now,   because I have kids, is catching critters.\nVanessa:  Oh yeah.\nDan:  Catching critters and keeping them. I would \nsay critters are generally small animals.   When I was a kid, I spent, I would say 50% \nof my life trying to catch frogs, lizards,   grasshoppers, snakes, bugs of any \nkind, and I would keep them in cages.   I would use nets to catch butterflies, terrariums, \naquariums, fish, anything like that. I caught and   kept lots and lots of critters. There was probably \na five-year phase where we didn't do that very   much. Funnily enough, even when we first got \nmarried, and you're into this too, I don't know   where she got this. Maybe it's infectious.\nVanessa:  We caught tad poles as kids.\nDan:  We would catch tad poles as just a married \ncouple. We'd go down to the pond and scoop   in and get some mucky, gucky tad poles and watch \nthem change into frogs. It's the miracle of life.  Vanessa:\nYou know what? I have a   distinct memory on our honeymoon, we were taking a \nhike, and you saw, I think this was the first time   I'd ever caught critters with you because, \nI don't know, maybe when we were dating ...  Dan:\nShe didn't know what she was signing up for.  Vanessa:\nMaybe when we were dating, we just   weren't in those situations. I remember we were on \na hike and you were in a stream picking up rocks,   and you were so excited. This is a good salamander \nspot. There might be salamanders. Then you found   one and I was so impressed.\nDan:  Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.\nVanessa:  How did you find that salamander because I caught \ntad poles maybe like every summer as a kid,   but I never caught salamanders or whole frogs or \nfish. We had nets and caught fireflies and stuff,   but I think you take it to the next level.\nDan:  Yeah. Especially as a kid, I took it to \nthe next level. One time I caught a five   foot snake. I didn't even know what kind \nit was, I just reached into the bushes.   I didn't grab it the right way. I was like \nswinging it through the air. That was probably   the dumbest thing I ever did honestly catching \ncritters as a child. It extends beyond that too.   I've always liked keeping fish. I love making fish \ntanks and the environments. Obviously you can do   that for frogs and reptiles. I have big dreams \nfor my son because he's also very into this.  Vanessa:\nOh yeah.   He is crazed about his net and catching stuff. He \njust loves that. I mean it's treasures in nature.  Dan:\nSoon enough,   our house will turn into a menagerie of critters.\nVanessa:  I just have one rule. I would ...\nDan:  Scorpions.\nVanessa:  I don't mind keeping frogs and lizards and fish.\nDan:  Snakes?\nVanessa:  But I don't want to keep any snakes.\nDan:  Oh, come on.\nVanessa:  I know a lot of snakes are harmless ...\nDan:  They're cute.\nVanessa:  ... but I would rather the snakes live \nunder our shed than live in our house.  Dan:\nThat's more dangerous.  Vanessa:\nWell, if they're not poisonous.   If they're not venomous, then they can catch \nrats and catch things and keep our chicken safe,   that type of thing.\nDan:  That's what snakes do?\nVanessa:  Yeah. A lot of chickens ...\nDan:  They protect chickens.\nVanessa:  Yeah. A lot of people, and this \nis getting a little deep ...  Dan:\nAre chickens critters?  Vanessa:\nI don't   this so. When I think of a critter, I think of \ncrawling, like something that goes like k-k-k-k,   like a little crawly thing.\nDan:  Am I a critter?\nVanessa:  That's a good question. I was going to say some \npeople, we have chickens, you might have seen   this on our YouTube channel before, some people \npurposefully have a rat snake or a black snake,   a garter snake that lives in their chicken \ncoop, and they eat like one egg per   two weeks or something. They don't eat that much.\nDan:  Is that good?\nVanessa:  They do it for protection. They're keeping rats \naway. They're keeping other things away from the   coop. There's a whole, let me tell you ...\nDan:  You want me to bring snakes into \nour family, well, but outside?  Vanessa:\nAs long as they are outside,   that's okay. I don't want snakes in my house.\nDan:  I have lots of good stories about snakes in \nthe house. One snake escaped in the house.  Vanessa:\nOh, don't tell me that.  Dan:\nMy mom found it under the couch months later   and it was dead.\nVanessa:  Oh no. Yeah.\nDan:  It was one of those classic situations of \nmom screams in the other room, and we're   like what? What?\nVanessa:  You kids have that snake in here?  Dan:\nDaniel,   gee, what is this thing? That's what she'd say.\nVanessa:  Well, do you want to share also while we're \non this topic, your first memory, the frog?  Dan:\nOh my very first memory.  Vanessa:\nYes. This will drill in the point that Dan   loves critters.\nDan:  Yeah. I caught a toad probably when I was \ntwo years old and I was, for some reason,   holding it off my deck and I dropped it down into \nthe bushes. I remember thinking, no, my toad. Then   I went down to look for it and I couldn't find it.\nVanessa:  This is Dan's first memory in life.\nDan:  Yeah, literally one, at least as far as I know.\nVanessa:  Well, there you go.\nDan:  Yeah. That's the point of it?\nVanessa:  A lifetime of catching critters started \nat a young age. Well, I think ...  Dan:\nYeah. How about you?  Vanessa:\nFor me?  Dan:\nWhat do you still do besides catching   lots of critters?\nVanessa:  I do catch tad poles still. That's fun. I \nthink the thing that first came to my mind,   and I tried to think about just like the first \nthing that came to my mind for each of these, is   when I was a kid I loved to dig in the dirt. \nMy sister and I had two best friends who lived   right across the street, and we spent hours in \nthe backyard just digging in the dirt. We built   things in the dirt. We had little inventions. We \nmade homes in the dirt. We did so many things.   Now I dig in the dirt, but I call it gardening.\nDan:  I think we have the wrong YouTube channel. \nWe just need to be covered in mud with like   snakes and gardening.\nVanessa:  Maybe that will be YouTube channel ...\nDan:  Number two.\nVanessa:  Number two, Dan catches critters and \nVanessa digs in the dirt and gardens.   I remember when I was in seventh grade at school, \nwe had a class, I think it was Home Ec., which   is like home economics. You learn about cooking, \nand sewing, and those types of things. There was   a hygiene section where you learned how to take \ncare of your hair, how to take care of your nails.   I remember specifically ...\nDan:  How to take care of your nails?\nVanessa:  I know.\nDan:  There's a class about that?\nVanessa:  Well, it was like how to, I don't know, some \npeople maybe don't learn that at home, like how   to trim your nails and stuff. This lady was one \nof those people that as a middle schooler, most   middle schoolers just roll their eyes at, like, \noh, you think I'm going to do that? Oh, I'm not   going to be like you, but she was our teacher. She \nwas telling us how to clean our nails and paint   them in this type of thing. I remember asking ...\nDan:  Was it for ladies only?\nVanessa:  Yeah, we were split by gender, so there was boys \nin one class, girls in the other just for Home   Ec. I remember her saying how to clean \nyour nails and make them look nice. I   remember asking in the class, I said, but \nwhat if I always have dirt under my nails?  Dan:\nYou raised your hands and asked that?  Vanessa:\nI asked that question. I was so   naive. I always have dirt under my nails. I can't \nget them clean like that. She looked at me like,   what? Like I had three heads on my head. What? \nWhy would you have dirt under your nails? You're   a seventh grade girl. I think after that ...\nDan:  Be proper.\nVanessa:  ... maybe when I was in eighth grade or so I \nhad a phase where I stopped playing in the dirt   and did other things. Now I have come full \ncircle and well, I took a shower recently,   so my nails are actually clean, but they're \nalmost always full of dirt. Just like our kids.  Dan:\nI'm sure you put in more   effort to get the dirt out now.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Kind of. Sometimes it works, sometimes \nit doesn't, but I have the same mindset as a   seventh grader of, well, my hands aren't \ngoing to be completely clean because ...  Dan:\nYou really do.  Vanessa:\n... I was just playing in the dirt.   What's the matter with that?\nDan:  If you look at Vanessa's wardrobe, \nI have more clothes than her   half the time.\nVanessa:  I don't really care about those kind of things.\nDan:  Yeah. She's not you're a typical girly \ngirl. Let's put it that way. A girly girl.  Vanessa:\nThat's okay.  Dan:\nThat's my sister.   Maybe we'll talk about her later.\nVanessa:  Okay. All right. Well, let's go to our next \nquestion. But before we do that, I want to ask   you, what is something that you did in childhood \nthat you still do now? Let us know in the   comments. All right. Let's go to question number \nthree. Question number three is about hobbies.   I'd like to know if you could wake up tomorrow \nand magically have any kind of education,   talent, or skill set, what would it be?\nDan:  Education or skill?\nVanessa:  Yeah, this is very broad.\nDan:  Yes. Well, when I think skill, I mean, I \nthink that I would want to be, and this is   a little stereotypical, an athlete of some kind, \nparticularly a hockey player. When you are playing   a sport and you really like that sport, you get \ninto the flow and you just live in that moment   and you just have so much fun. I can remember \nas a kid, one time I scored a goal to win the   game in hockey, and that's just the greatest \nfeeling ever. Now, if you add to that, a big   stadium full of fans cheering your name ... Am I \negotistical? I don't know. That would just be the   ultimate thrill to score a goal and hear everybody \ncheering. I would say, yeah, either an athlete of   some kind or a performer. I think you get the same \nkind of feeling if you are acting, if you're maybe   a standup comedian and you're making people laugh.\nDan:  Even to a certain degree, I think \nbeing a really great teacher,   being a really great teacher probably gives you \nthat same kind of feeling of you're performing   and bringing value and people are entertained. \nIf I were to have like, I wasn't thinking so much   education, I was thinking more skills, so I would \nwake up tomorrow and I'd be the best hockey player   on earth.\nVanessa:  Wow.\nDan:  Maybe that'd be a little bit boring \njust beating everybody right and left.   I'm sure you still have to work though. \nYeah, I'd have great athletic prowess.  Vanessa:\nCool.  Dan:\nHow about you? What would you   want to wake up tomorrow with?\nVanessa:  Well, I said something a little bit stereotypical \ntoo. I had my primary answer and then   a maybe cheat answer. I think if I \ncould wake up tomorrow with a skill,   maybe I said something a little more realistic. \nI said, I'd like to be able to play the ukulele   really well.\nDan:  The ukulele?\nVanessa:  I don't play the ukulele. I play the flute. I \ndon't know. I just thought if I could have a   cool skill, I mean, that's something that I could \ntake outside. I could be playing while the kids   are playing.\nDan:  This is a very humble dream.\nVanessa:  Maybe it is. I didn't want to think for \ntoo long about this. I wanted to give you   my initial response. Yeah, I think it would be \ncool. A guitar is pretty big to take somewhere.   A piano would be amazing, but it's not quite as \nportable. I just feel like sometimes when you're,   I had this image, like you're sitting around \na bonfire and the sun setting and you're just   chatting with your friends, just having a ukulele \nand playing some music, oh, that just brings the   atmosphere to a very warm place.\nDan:  You could play Wheels On the Bus for our children.\nVanessa:  I could maybe play Wheels \nOn the Bus in five minutes.  Dan:\nThat's the first song that comes to my   head. The version we listen to, It's like \ndo, do, do, do, and I just hear ukulele.  Vanessa:\nYeah. Well, if you   play the ukulele and you have any recommendations, \nlet me know in the comments, but my cheat answer,   because I wasn't sure if it was a skillset or a \ncharacter trait, but I said unlimited patience.   If I could wake up in the morning ...\nDan:  That's an education.\nVanessa:  ... and oh, I guess you can learn patience. If I \ncould have unlimited patience with my children,   that would be amazing, and with myself.\nDan:  They'd get away with you too much though.\nVanessa:  I don't know. I think you can be firm and also be \npatient. It doesn't mean you have no standards,   but I think that I would, yeah, just be able to \nbe a little bit, I think you're always a better   parent when you are more patient.\nDan:  They certainly test the patience.\nVanessa:  Yes. Unlimited patience would be awesome. What \nabout you? If you could wake up tomorrow and have   any education, talent, or skill set, what would \nit be? Would it be speaking English fluently,   or maybe it would be something else. Let us know \nin the comments. Let's go to question number four.   Question number four is about travel. I'd like \nto know where is the next place in the US that   you'd like to visit?\nDan:  Oh, I've got to travel in the US?\nVanessa:  Yeah. I wanted it to be a little more \nspecific and it might be interesting to   some of our international students \nto learn about places in the US.  Dan:\nI'm joking because there are a lot of amazing   places in the US, but I really love international \ncities like Europe and Asia. I just think they're   so interesting.\nVanessa:  I know.\nDan:  But the US has lots of beautiful natural \nenvironments, so I would probably travel   to Washington or Oregon.\nVanessa:  You know what?\nDan:  You'd say the same thing.\nVanessa:  My first answer was the northwest, Seattle, \nthat area, Oregon, and I crossed it off.  Dan:\nDid you think that I was going to say that?  Vanessa:\nNo, I thought of somewhere   I would rather visit first.\nDan:  Oh, I'm with you. Okay.\nVanessa:  I'd like to go there too.\nDan:  Yeah. The Pacific northwest because I've never \nbeen there and it just looks so stunningly   beautiful there, at least for part of the year. \nIt has really big mountains and really dense green   forests, and it has the ocean as well. I really \nlove a landscape that has lots of rocky features,   but also the ocean. That's one of my favorite \nkinds of landscapes. I would probably go there,   and it has really cool cities too. Seattle is \na really awesome city and you could jump up,   I mean I've never been there, but it looks really \ncool, and you can jump up to Vancouver as well   and get that full Pacific northwest experience. \nThat's where I would choose. I could do lots of   outdoorsy stuff. I could see a different side of \nthe country and even do some urban things as well.  Vanessa:\nYeah. That sounds like a fun place. In fact,   one of my options too.\nDan:  Yeah. What did you choose instead?\nVanessa:  Well, I thought about that.\nDan:  Wait, let me guess. Grand Canyon.\nVanessa:  Close.\nDan:  New Mexico.\nVanessa:  A little more general.\nDan:  Arizona.\nVanessa:  I said I want to rent an RV and have a big \ntour of the west, southwest, national parks.  Dan:\nOh this is a regional thing.  Vanessa:\nYeah, because there's so many   amazing national parks in the west, southwest, \nnot even southwest, but just the west of the US.   I think that would be an awesome two month journey \nwhere you say I'm going to book a bunch of camping   places and you're not having to like tent camp. \nI think that might be a little too intense for us   for two months, but in an RV with ...\nVanessa:  ... Were intense for us for two months. But, \nin an RV, it would still be in cool locations,   maybe closer to the national parks, \nand you get to see a lot. Because,   two months ago, we went to Colorado, \nin Colorado Springs and I'd never seen   the Rocky Mountains or that area of the U.S. \nAnd I was blown away. It is so beautiful. Yeah,   I've been reading some books about that area \nof the U.S., and historical fiction about the   history there. And yeah, I'm fascinated. I think \nthat would be really cool to check out some of   the history, check out some beautiful places. \nWe like hiking, so it seems like a good fit.  Dan:\nYeah. And it's very different   from where we live now.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Surprisingly, so.\nDan:  Yeah. So, I chose the wettest part of \nthe country and you chose the driest.  Vanessa:\nYeah. Yeah. I think   that was really shocking to me, when we \nwent to Colorado. It's super dry there.   And I've been in dry climates before-\nDan:  And, Arizona is way drier.\nVanessa:  ... Oh, I bet. Yeah, there's deserts there.\nDan:  Mm-hmm.\nVanessa:  But I feel like, being somewhere \nlike that, even though the U.S.   is the same country, it feels so different, \nthat it does feel like you've gone almost into   a different world when you visit different \nclimates like that and different geography.  Dan:\nIt is very   easily could be many countries.\nVanessa:  Oh, it could very easily be.\nDan:  Maybe it should be.\nVanessa:  Many countries. So, I want to know for you, if \nyou live in the U.S. or if you got the chance to   visit the U.S., where would you like to visit? \nWhere's the first place that you would like to go   if you got to come to the U.S.? Let us know in the \ncomments. And, let's go to question number four. I   actually meant question number five.\nDan:  Whoops.\nVanessa:  So question number five, the topic is food.\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  Something that we love. I would \nlike to know what is a food from   your travels, our travels, that \nyou wish you could have again?  Dan:\nMan, this is the hardest question,   because we've had so many delicious meals in our \ntravels. And we just love different food as well.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nAnd this is very tied up in nostalgia for me too,   because we lived in South Korea for three years. \nAnd, the meals were so different from America,   and distinct, and we actually enjoyed them. So, \nnow I can't get them the same way. So, if you   go to a Korean restaurant in America, you're going \nto spend a lot more to get something that isn't as   probably as quality as what you'd get there.\nVanessa:  It's a different atmosphere, all of that.\nDan:  So I had a tough decision to make. So, I chose \na meal called [foreign language 00:27:46].  Vanessa:\nOkay.  Dan:\nWhich means three layered flesh in Korean.  Vanessa:\nThick bacon, basically.  Dan:\nIt's bacon. It's thick bacon. But,   you would cook this on a grill in front of you \nin a restaurant with lots of people and you'd   hit a little bell and it goes dingdong. And then \nwaitress says, \" [foreign language 00:28:05].\" And   she fills up your water. It's more a whole \nexperience than just the food. But if-  Vanessa:\nIf you finish your side dishes, they'll bring you   endless amounts of other side dishes.\nDan:  ... Yes. Endless side dishes. So, it's not really \njust one thing, it's more of the whole experience.   And it has a lot of nostalgia for us, because you \ncan't really get the same thing here. You can,   but it's just not quite the same.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  And it was always delicious, especially in \nSouth Korea. Even us, relatively thin people,   we lost weight when we went to South Korea, \nbecause it's just way less rich food in general,   compared to American diets. And, we didn't have \nvery much money, so we didn't eat this all the   time. We just ate it sometimes. So, that was \nalways a winner. And, I have to add another one,   because we have traveled in Europe as well. \nAnd, technically this meal is tastier,   I'm thinking of... Can you guess?\nVanessa:  Cinque Terre.\nDan:  Yep.\nVanessa:  Cinque Terre.\nDan:  Yes. There was a seafood meal we ate in Cinque \nTerre that had... I don't even remember what we   ate fish pasta.\nVanessa: I had a octopus.\nDan:  Amazing wine.\nVanessa:  And pasta meat thing. Yeah.\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  Crazy.\nDan:  And, that was also a good vibe. Nostalgic \nexperience. Because, when I think back to it, we   did a lot of beautiful hikes on that trip. And \nthen, we ended in the last little town and ate at   that restaurant and it was really delicious.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  So, it all worked out perfectly.\nVanessa:  Even if we go back there, it will be a different \nvibe and different feel, because like you said,   I think, food is really tied to nostalgia. So, \nthe atmosphere and you can't just eat the food   separately from anything else.\nDan:  Bing bong.\nVanessa:  Yeah. We don't have bells on \nthe table to call the waitress.  Dan:\nIf you're Korean and watching this,   you're like, \"What's the big deal about that?\"\nVanessa:  But for us-\nDan:  But for us, it's just so, \"This is so funny and-\"  Vanessa:\n... It was so great. And yeah,   we love that experience.\nDan:  ... Yes.\nVanessa:  Mine is-\nDan:  So how about you? Yes.\nVanessa:  ... Very similar. In fact, yeah-\nDan:  Was it the same meal?\nVanessa:  ... No, I thought about saying, not specifically \nsome [inaudible 00:30:22], but just eating   outside. It's basically on a sidewalk, there's \nlittle plastic tables and you're cooking this   type of thing that Dan's talking about. But, the \none that I thought about was also in Korea because   there's a lot of nostalgia.\nDan:  Is it [inaudible 00:30:37]?\nVanessa:  I almost said [inaudible 00:30:39].\nDan:  I thought that too.\nVanessa:  I almost said [inaudible 00:30:40].\nDan:  It's not always the best food, \nbut the environment was perfect.  Vanessa:\nYeah. But what I said also because I like   the food so much is a meal called dak-galbi.\nDan:  Oh.\nVanessa:  And, there was a restaurant specifically the \nrestaurant that we went to often in Incheon, which   was the city we lived in for the first two years \nin Korea. And, our first week living there, it was   my birthday in September. And, we went there \nwith a bunch of new friends. And, I had never   eaten something like this before, where we sat \nat a table, and they had a burner on the table,   and they had all the ingredients \nthere, and it was uncooked chicken,   cabbage, rice cakes, all of these things, \ncarrots, the sauce. It was all in this thing. And,   the person who was the server was helping to-\nDan:  She tossed it up.\nVanessa:  ... Helping to cook it. And we were \nall just sitting there and watching   it. It's very different from an American \nhibachi experience. That's a similar   experience or similar idea where someone is \ncooking in front of you, but this was different,   much more casual.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  And I remember sitting there for my \nbirthday, surrounded by all these   new friends, in a new city, eating this food that \nI thought was so exciting, and they're cooking it   in front of us. And it is amazingly delicious.\nDan:  Mm-hmm. It was very yummy.\nVanessa:  And, that place is, yeah, full of so many \nmemories. So, whenever someone came to visit us   from the U.S., or we made a new friend, we would \nalways go to that restaurant. And then, the third   year we lived in South Korea, we moved to a \ncity called Suan, which is about an hour away.   And, after that year, that restaurant closed. No.\nDan:  No.\nVanessa:  So, when this question says, something \nyou wish you could try again,   this will always be just a wish.\nDan:  I'm sure that lady opened up \nanother restaurant, right?  Vanessa:\nI hope so. I   hope she is world renowned as amazing dak-galbi \nrestaurant, because we had dak-galbi also in Suan,   and that was nice. That lady was super nice. \nWe talked through Google translate a lot.  Dan:\nYeah. Their dak-galbi was good too.  Vanessa:\nYeah, but there something about   that first place that really-\nDan:  It had the nostalgia.\nVanessa:  ... It has a special place in my \nheart. So, that's what I would say.  Dan:\nIt is funny though,   we would take Korean people there and \nthey'd be like, \"Yeah, it's pretty good.\"  Vanessa:\nBut for us, that was-  Dan:\nWe're like, \"This is so awesome.\"  Vanessa:\n... So fun. Yeah. Anyway, you can see,   we get very excited about food. Now, maybe I know \nwhy our children are also excited about food.   They're crazed about food, so.\nDan:  It's because their kids.\nVanessa:  Yeah. But some kids are very picky.\nDan:  Well, that's true. Yeah, they do \nlike more food than average kids.  Vanessa:\nOur kids love all this type of stuff   just as passionately as us. All right. So I have a \nquestion for you. What is a food from your travels   that you wish you could have again? It might be \nbecause it was good. It might be because of the   vibe, and the atmosphere, and the memories, the \nnostalgia, like what we talked about. Let us know   in the comments what food you wish you could have \nagain, and we'll learn about food from around the   world. All right, let's go to the next question, \nquestion number six. I think we're on six.  Dan:\nYeah.  Vanessa:\nAll right, question number six.   Question number six is about nature. This \nis maybe a little silly of a question,   but that's okay.\nDan:  We like critters, so that's okay.\nVanessa:  Yeah, as you can tell. So, this question is, if \nyou could have any defense mechanism of an animal,   what would you have? So if you could \nhave that type of defense mechanism   in your body or become you-\nDan:  In my body.\nVanessa:  ... Yes. What would it be? So can we maybe \nexplain quickly what a defense mechanism is?  Dan:\nYeah, sure. So, a   defense mechanism is something that an animal has \nor uses a feature that protects it from predators.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nOr is a way to either get the predator   to go away or escape the predator.\nVanessa:  So maybe quills on a porcupine, something like \nthis. And we can even say humans have a defense   mechanism. We might use that emotionally.\nDan:  Oh yeah.\nVanessa:  To say, \"Oh, why is he always making jokes?\" \nIt's actually a defense mechanism because   he experienced a lot of trauma in his \nlife, and joking, and laughing helps him to   not feel so vulnerable.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  Or something like this. It's a more of an \nemotional thing. So you can have a defense   mechanism as a human, but I want to know, in a \nsilly way, if you could imagine having an animal's   defense mechanism, what would it be?\nDan:  Mine would be... This is \na little bit of a cop out.  Vanessa:\nOkay.  Dan:\nFlying.  Vanessa:\nOh.  Dan:\nBecause now we don't really   associate flying with just defense, but \nit can certainly be used as a defense,   so a bird will fly away when you come near it. And \nwe were talking about it earlier and saying that   flying probably evolved as a defense mechanism for \nan animal to get out of the way from a predator   really efficiently and effectively.\nVanessa:  Yeah, I almost said flying too for this one.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  It's a good one.\nDan:  So, I mean, but who doesn't want to fly?\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  I mean, of course then you \nhave to be really lightweight   and you're probably not very intimidating. \nAnd then, you have to be a bat or a bird.  Vanessa:\nYou could be an Eagle.  Dan:\nBut, if I could still be me and fly,   then I would choose that.\nVanessa:  Yeah, just imagine, you're walking down a dark \nalley, I don't know why you're walking down a   dark alley, and then somebody dangerous \nsteps out and all of a sudden your wings   open up and you fly away.\nDan:  Ooh, they pop out of my back like an angel.\nVanessa:  That's it. Yeah, that's it. I think there's \nsome X-Men or superhero or something   that does that.\nDan:  Oh, yeah, probably. We \ndon't know about that stuff.  Dan:\nBird man.  Vanessa:\nBird man. Is that a-  Dan:\nOr Batman, squawk man.  Vanessa:\n... Eagle man.  Dan:\nEagle man.  Vanessa:\nOkay.  Dan:\nRaven man. Robin man.   Robin.\nVanessa:  California condo man.\nDan:  Blue bird man.\nVanessa:  These are all the birds we know. Okay, well-\nDan:  And we're not into superheroes, so.\nVanessa:  ... Flying is a good one. I almost said that. \nAnd you know what? I think, I have something   different I'd like to share. But, I think for me \nactually flying is probably more realistic. Not   like I can actually fly, but because if I'm faced \nwith danger, I'm probably more likely to flee.  Dan:\nOh yeah. Vanessa:\nThan to fight. So, we call this fight or flight.   When you're in a dangerous situation, either \ndangerous physically or dangerous emotionally,   we say, \"Oh, your fight or flight kicks in.\"   So, either you fight and you try \nto win or you flee. So, that's-  Dan:\nRun away.  Vanessa:\n... The flight part. You're not actually flying,   but maybe you try to run away from that dangerous \nsituation. And I think for me, that's more true.   I'm more likely to run away from danger.\nDan:  Lady folk, in general.\nVanessa:  But I said something dinner... Dinner? \nDifferent. I said something different.  Dan:\nFood is still on her mind.  Vanessa:\nOh, food. I said something   different. I said, a horny toad, which is actually \na type of lizard. A horny toad has something very   interesting that they do. They, when faced with \ndanger can stop their blood flow to their heart.   Their blood fills up in them and they shoot \nblood out of their eyes at their aggressor. What?  Dan:\nInto their aggressor's eyes?  Vanessa:\nAt least at their aggressor. And the blood   isn't venomous or anything like this, it's just \nshocking. So, I thought it would be hilarious.  Dan:\nThat would shock me.  Vanessa:\nIf, \"Oh, hi, I'm Vanessa. Nice Vanessa.\"   And then, somebody is a bad person and I just \nwent bzz and shot blood out my eyes at them.  Dan:\nYeah.  Vanessa:\nI think it would be so shocking   that I could be saved.\nDan:  Sure.\nVanessa:  But, maybe flying is something I would \nrealistically be more likely to do.   Oh, I probably would fly away instead of \nfighting. But, shooting blood out of your   eyes if you're in danger?\nDan:  It's not going to win you a lot of dates.\nVanessa:  No.\nDan:  \"Hey baby.\"\nVanessa: \"Look what I can do.\" Yeah, but isn't that crazy, \nthat it's actually a lizard, but the horn toad   can shoot blood out of its eyes? How in the world-  Dan:\nAnd how does that even help it?  Vanessa:\n... Did even nature decide to do this?  Dan:\nI don't know.  Vanessa:\nI mean, it must be   in danger in some ways that it goes away, it makes \nstuff go away because of that. Anyway, crazy, so.  Dan:\nThe animal is just so disgusted,   it doesn't want to eat it.\nVanessa:  I know. \"You got blood shooting out of your eyes. \nWhat?\" So, I want to know for you, if you could   have any animal's defense mechanism, what would it \nbe? There are many crazy things out there. There   are ants that shoot acid, there are porcupines \nthat have quills. This is a great way to expand   your vocabulary in a fun way. If you would like, \nyou can type into Google amazing animal defense   mechanisms. And you'll see many lists of cool \nthings that animals do if you like that stuff.   So I want to know, let me know in the comments, \nwhat would you like to defend yourself with?   All right, let's go to our next question.\nDan:  \"Caw.\"\nVanessa:  Question number seven is about holidays.   The question is, what is your favorite holiday \ntradition? And I have a feeling that we might   have the same one.\nDan:  We had to have.\nVanessa:  So do you want to say it at the same time?\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  On three?\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  Okay. 3, 2, 1,\nDan:  Christmas tree.\nVanessa:  Decorating the Christmas tree.\nDan:  Yes. Decorating the Christmas tree.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Okay. Why don't you explain first? Why \ndo you like decorating the Christmas tree?  Dan:\nMan. There's probably   a lot of reasons. One primary reason is that \nthis is a tradition that our family always did.  Vanessa:\nMm-hmm.  Dan:\nSo it has a lot of nostalgia tied up into it.   And we don't have a lot of other traditions that \nour family always did. So there's Thanksgiving,   which is, you have a meal and you talk about \nwhat you're thankful for. And that's another   big one. But, maybe it's just because you \nput presents under a tree that, as a kid,   you just can't get enough of Christmas.\nVanessa:  And now?\nDan:  Yes. And now, I really enjoy picking out a \nChristmas tree. We're really nature-y. So,   we get a real Christmas tree and I like the \nsmell of the pine. It just hits all of the   right senses and feelings. And then, you get \nto decorate it. So, your kids are excited,   and you get to hang up all the stuff, and put \nup the lights, and there's a whole process. And,   it's funny because it's probably the most \nuseless thing that we do, but it's one of   the best things.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I think, even before we had \nkids, this was a big deal for us.  Dan:\nOf course.  Vanessa:\nIn our marriage,   because yeah, it's something that you do with \nyour parents growing up. And then, for us,   when we got married and we started doing \nthat with each other, it felt like,   \"Oh, this is our new life. This is us. \nWe're doing this together.\" And you're-  Dan:\nWe're starting the new generation.  Vanessa:\n... Yeah, our new traditions. We're doing this in   our own way. Yeah, it felt different. I said that \nfor me, because when I was a kid, we didn't have a   real Christmas tree, we had a fake tree. But even \nin that, I was so excited about it. First of all,   I'll set the stage, my mom popped popcorn. So, we \nate popcorn and it smelled great. We listened to   Christmas music.\nDan:  Always good.\nVanessa:  And then, we all sat in the living \nroom, and because we had a fake tree,   there's different fake trees, but the kind we \nhad, there was a stem in the middle and it had   different holes and you could hook the branches \nin and the branches had different colored rings   on them, so you could see the big ones are on the \nbottom. But, because these were closed in a box   the entire year, they were flat. So, we \nwould all sit around the Christmas tree,   bending the branches to look realistic. So, we \nwould bend each of the little branches on it and   then put it in. And we'd look at each other's and \nsay, \"Oh, that one doesn't look good.\" Or, \"Oh,   that was really great.\"\nDan:  This is all blasphemy to me.\nVanessa:  Because you always had a real tree.\nDan:  It had to be real.\nVanessa:  And then we-\nDan:  If there's not a fire hazard in your living room,   it's not Christmas.\nVanessa:  ... Yeah, that's a big reason why we had a \nfake tree is because when my dad was a kid,   they had a real tree.\nDan:  Oh yeah.\nVanessa: Maybe for one Christmas, I don't remember \nif it was for longer than that. And they had   a train set going around it so they could turn \non the electric train and it would go around the   bottom of the Christmas tree, not in the branches, \nbut just on the ground, and it caught fire.  Dan:\nOh.  Vanessa:\nAnd my dad said one of his first memories   is him as a little kid, getting a cup of water and \nthrowing it on the Christmas tree fire. This is   huge hazard. And there's so many warnings.\nDan:  I mean, I don't think so much anymore.\nVanessa:  Yeah, this is a big deal.\nDan:  Christmas trees are safe.\nVanessa:  Christmas trees are not safe, because they say \nnow, I think it's more known now that you should   always keep water, so you have the Christmas tree \nthat's cut and you put it in a little basin of   water, and if there's not water in there, the tree \nwill dry out and it will catch fire really easily.   But, if it's filled with water, then the tree \nis hydrated and it won't catch fire as easily.  Dan:\nBut also, 60s electronics, versus-  Vanessa:\nOkay. That's true.  Dan:\n... Today's electronics. They're not   going to catch fire the same way.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  Probably.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  Christmas trees are safe and the best.\nVanessa:  Dan loves Christmas trees. So, I remember, \nyeah, we would do that, and then we would   decorate the tree. And my mom always had one \nornament, which I now have that was the first   ornament we put on the tree.\nDan:  Which one was that?\nVanessa:  It's the ball that has lots of \nlittle beads on it. And it's got-  Dan:\nBall with beads.  Vanessa:\n... Ribbons, and knots, and stuff on it.   We have it.\nDan:  Well, I love Christmas trees and \nI can't remember this ornament.  Vanessa:\nOh, well it's in our house.  Dan:\nThat's good. It'll be refreshing   this year to see it later.\nVanessa:  And, she put that on the tree and that \nsignified, we can start to decorate the tree.   So yeah, we would decorate the tree together \nand it was just a nice time to do that.  Dan:\nHow did you guys sit back and not decorate   the tree right away? Our children are like, \n\"Bah, get all the stuff. Put it on right away.\"  Vanessa:\nYeah, we did the ornaments. We   were busy doing the branches.\nDan:  Maybe because it's two girls versus two boys.\nVanessa:  I don't know. But, we did it and it was \nfun. And I remember when we got married,   that was my first real Christmas tree. We \nwent to a place and got a real tree and-  Dan:\nThat was your first?  Vanessa:\n... Yeah.  Dan:\nOh, we got the little one.  Vanessa:\nWe got a little tree. Yeah.  Dan:\nThat we planted later.  Vanessa:\nOh yeah. Dan:\nThat's another thing you can do   sometimes in America, but it's more difficult.\nVanessa:  Yeah, you can get it with the root ball on \nthe bottom. The first year we were married-  Dan:\nIt's a lot heavier.  Vanessa:\n... Oh my goodness, it was   so heavy. I remember it took three of us.\nDan:  It was three feet tall.\nVanessa:  Me, you, and your brother to take it   out of the car and drag it into our house.\nDan:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).\nVanessa:  Because it was so big, but we wanted to plant it \nlater, we didn't want to just cut a tree down. So,   we got this tree with a root ball, \nbut ever since then, we've just gotten   a cut tree, and put it in our house, and \ndecorated it. And yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Dan:\nAlways a happy time.  Vanessa:\nYeah. Well, I want to know for you, what is   your favorite holiday tradition? It might not be \nabout Christmas. It could be about any holiday.   But, I want to know about your experience. Let us \nknow in the comments, what's your favorite holiday   tradition? And we'll go on to our next question. \nQuestion number nine is about sports and exercise.   What is the most recent sport that you did?\nDan:  Well, this happened just about a week ago \nactually. And it's the first time I ever did this   outdoors. It was rock climbing. Is \nthis a sport? I guess, it's a sport.  Vanessa:\nIt's considered exercise.  Dan:\nYeah. And so, my brother-in-law is,   let's just say, obsessed with rock climbing. And, \nhe's gotten pretty good at it lately. And so,   he met us in between where he lives and \nus. We live about eight hours away. And,   we were in West Virginia, which has actually a lot \nof good rock climbing. And we chose a spot and he   had all the gear, he's got the ropes, he's got \nthe shoes, he's got the backpacks, he's got the   harness, and all this stuff. And he actually... \nOh the helmet too. Don't forget the helmet.   And, he geared me up to do it. And, I \nwas actually pretty nervous about it,   and not because I'm afraid of heights actually, \nhe's more scared of Heights than I am.   I think it's funny that he likes doing this \nso much. He says every single time he does it,   he's scared.\nVanessa:  Oh.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  Interesting.\nDan:  But I'm not afraid of heights, so I wasn't really \nworried about that. I probably should have been   more worried about it.\nVanessa:  What were you worried about?\nDan:  I'm a perfectionist, or a completionist. So, \nit really bothers me if I try something and I   can't finish it.\nVanessa:  Ah, so you wanted to be \nable to make it to the top.  Dan:\nSo, I knew I could probably do some easy stuff,   but he's a lot better than I am. So, I knew \nthat he would be wanting to move on to something   more challenging. And, I didn't really know if I \nwanted to have to just watch, or try it and only   get partway. In the end, I did do that. So, the \nfirst one was a easy one. I don't think it was-  Vanessa:\nI'll show you a picture here of Dan   making it all the way to the top. Yes.\nDan:  ... Yes. So, I do naturally have a good body type \nfor climbing. I'm lightweight. I climb a lot of   trees. I like to hike and do all that stuff. So, I \ncan figure it out. But, the hand strength is just   on another level to rock climb.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  And so, I did the easier one and I made it to the \ntop. But, all the other ones, I made it partway.   And, I actually remember, we were with \nanother guy too, his name was Jim. And,   Jim was really inspiring, because... And don't \nworry, this was totally safe. There was a rope   tied to the very top. They call it top climbing? \nTop rope? I don't remember the terms. There's a   lot of terms in rock climbing.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  And so, he was tied to the top and if you fall \nthat will catch you right away and it's not a   big deal.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  But, for me, if I fall one time doing that, I'm \nlike, \"All right, I'm done.\" That's how I feel.   But he fell probably 15 times on a climb and \njust kept on trying, and trying, and trying,   and he made it to the top and I was like, \"Wow.\" \nAnd, when he got down, I said, \"I have to try   a lot more than I would, because I just \nsaw him persevere.\" So, it's a very good   perseverance sport.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  So, I tried, and tried, and tried, and I got one \nthird of the way, because it was really difficult.   It's called crack climbing. And there's just \na crack in the wall. And, you got to put your   hands there. And, just-\nVanessa:  That's so hard.\nDan:  ... There's nothing except for a crack and \nlittle tiny ledges. So, their experienced,   so they got up the first part really easily. \nSo, the girl who was with us, she said,   \"Yeah, that was tricky.\" But, I \nwas stuck on the first part for...   It felt like 20 minutes, it was probably more \nlike 10 minutes. They just got up that part. But   it was literally just a little thin rock you had \nto put your fingers in, barely any foothold. But,   I saw Jim fall, and fall, and fall, and I \nkept on trying and I finally did it. Yes.  Vanessa:\nWow. Man, that is not up my alley at all.  Dan:\nYeah. Brad asked me... Brad's my   brother-in-law. He said, \"Do you think Vanessa \nwould ever do this with you?\" And I was like-  Dan:\nBrad's my brother-in-law. He said,   \"Do you think Vanessa would ever do this with \nyou?\" And I was like, \"I don't think...\" I can't   imagine you wanting to do that.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I don't like heights like that, and I feel \nlike I can't just do something like that like you.   I would need to go to the climbing gym and feel \ncomfortable with it, because at least for me,   that takes a lot of upper body strength, \nyour abs, your arms, your fingers. I think   maybe for you, you were able to make it to the \ntop of the easier one and halfway up or a third   of the way up the other ones because you're not \nafraid of heights and your strength is distributed   differently than mine.\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  But I think for something like that, I would need \nto massively feel more comfortable with heights   and go to the gym in advance.\nDan:  The girl who was with us was the best one there.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nShe was   amazing.\nVanessa:  I bet.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  I mean, you can practice that and do it.\nDan:  Women can definitely do it.\nVanessa:  Yeah. That's the cool thing.\nDan:  She was kind of like spider monkey, though.\nVanessa:  Going everywhere.\nDan:  She hadn't had any children yet.\nVanessa:  Yeah maybe.\nDan: Children does a number on \nyou. I speak from experience.  Vanessa:\nYeah? In any case, I think that seems like   the kind of exercise or sport that I would need to \npractice in advance before going outside to do it,   and inside where there's, I don't \nknow, maybe more predictability-  Dan:\nMats.  Vanessa:\n... or practice, that would be better for me.  Dan:\nI thought it was more fun outside.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nBecause I've done climbing gyms before,   and it's okay, but outside's a whole \nadventure. It did take forever though.  Vanessa:\nYeah. You have to hook up everything.  Dan:\nWe did four climbs and we were there all day.   You're watching other people go, and also one \nperson has to be the... I forget what it's called.  Vanessa:\nBelay.  Dan:\nBelay. Yeah. One person's holding you,   making sure you're not going to fall down, so \nthey actually hold you up from the other end.  Vanessa:\nCool.  Dan:\nI don't know all the terms,   but you can imagine it, right?\nVanessa:  Yeah. It seemed like cool camaraderie \ntoo with everybody who was there.  Dan:\nYeah. That was probably the best part.  Vanessa:\nAs in we all went together,   and then I went on a hike with Dan's sister \nand our kids and Dan's parents. We were   at the same place, but hiking instead. But we were \ngoing back and watching them too. It seemed like   everyone who was in this area climbing just was \nchill. They were all the type of perseverant,   motivated type of person, who's like, \"I'm \ngoing to climb this rock,\" a personal challenge.  Dan:\nIt's a culture, for sure.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nYeah. One guy walked up and there was a climb,   they all have funny names, and he was like, \"Did \nyou do chalk line? Cool, bro.\" It was totally-  Vanessa:\nTrying to size each other up.  Dan:\nSurfer vibes.  Vanessa:\nYeah. I could see that. Well,   sounds like a fun time, even though it was hard.\nDan:  Oh, it twas very hard. Very hard.\nVanessa:  Bonding together.\nDan:  Yes. How about you? Have you \ntried any sports recently?  Vanessa:\nYeah, I was trying to think about this,   and the answer is not really, but-\nDan:  Baseball.\nVanessa:  I was going to say baseball.\nDan:  Really?\nVanessa:  Because our four year old, almost five year \nold, maybe by the time you're watching this   he'll be five, our five year old son has been into \nhitting the baseball with a baseball bat lately.   In June, we visited Pittsburgh when Dan went-\nDan:  Rock climbing.\nVanessa:  ... rock climbing. After that, \nwe went to a baseball field with   Dan's sister and their cousins and some \nfamily, little kids. We tried to kind of   play a baseball field.\nDan:  Tried. Yes.\nVanessa:  There's bases, and we were all hitting. The kids \nhit, we hit, and I've always liked hitting a   baseball. I think it's pretty fun.\nDan:  That's when you realize how many \nrules there are in baseball.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\n\"Don't run with the bat.\" \"First base is over   there.\" \"No, you have to stop on the base.\" \"Wait, \nhe's going to throw the ball to you.\" It's like,   forget about it. Just let him hit the ball.\nVanessa:  Yeah. It was really funny to see our son hit \nthe ball. He was just so excited that he hit it   that he was holding onto the bat and he ran to \nthird base. Like, \"No, no, no. That way drop the   bat. Go that way.\"\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  We were just having fun. Yeah, it was fun, \nand I like hitting. Yeah. I've always liked   hitting a baseball. Even though it wasn't \norganized, like an actual organized sport,   I think that was still a sport. It \nwasn't too much exercise, but it was fun.  Dan:\nI have a funny story about   baseball. Can I share it?\nVanessa:  Yes.\nDan:  When I was a kid.\nVanessa:  Go ahead.\nDan:  When I was a kid, I played baseball up until \ncoach pitch, which is where the coach is pitching,   not the players. Then I started getting \nscared of how fast the ball was coming.   At least back then, that's how I felt. But one \ntime I was the first baseman, and in baseball,   it's a very slow sport, right? For kids, you \njust start getting distracted when they're not   hitting the ball and you're just waiting out \nthere. So, I was pretending to be Darth Vader   with earth fader with my glove over my face. \nI was literally standing on first base going,   and the player hit the ball \nand hit me on the glove,   and we totally missed the play and it was \nbecause I was pretending to be Darth Vader   on first base.\nVanessa:  There you go.\nDan:  That's my story.\nVanessa:  Wow.\nDan:  That's why I quit baseball.\nVanessa:  Oh man.\nDan: Actually, that's not why.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  It's because I would practice with my \nbrother and he would throw really hard and   I didn't want to get hit by the ball.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I mean, I don't blame you.\nDan:  Baseball.\nVanessa:  I wouldn't want to get hit by a baseball either. \nIn the US, it's pretty common for kids to do,   they call it little league, so there's different \nstages, and one stage might be like a parent is   throwing the ball to the kids, or it's sitting on \na tee, it's sitting on a little stand and the kids   just have to try to hit the ball. Then the next \nlevel might be another player is throwing it, or   then the coach is throwing it as you get more and \nmore advanced. So, it's kind of working you up to   being a better player.\nDan:  To the majors.\nVanessa:  To the majors. Well, that was your first \nanswer, right? You wished you could be   a famous sports player.\nDan:  I'd take the best baseball player,   or just really great.\nVanessa:  Cool. Okay.\nDan:  Yeah. Any sport. I love sport.\nVanessa:  Well, I want to ask you the same question. What \nwas the most recent sport that you've played?   It could be an organized sport like baseball, \nor it could be something that's just more   exercise like-\nDan: Like rock climbing.\nVanessa:  ... rock climbing, but some people might \nsay it's a sport. Let us know in the   comments what's the most recent sport you've \nplayed, and we'll go on to our next question.   Question number 10 is about electronics. This \nis another hypothetical question. If you could   invent any new electronic device, \nwhat would it be and what would it do?  Dan:\nWhen I first   was thinking about this, I thought gadgets, \nlike a new toaster that never burnt the toast.  Vanessa:\nOkay.  Dan:\nBut I think when I think of   noble uses for electronics, I think of the medical \nfield. My electronic invention would be a tiny   robot that kills cancer.\nVanessa:  Oh okay.\nDan: A cancer killing search and destroy robot.\nVanessa:  Wow. That's noble.\nDan:  I think they might be working on this.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I don't know much about that field.\nDan:  I think there is some kind of tiny robot, \nfor lack of a better word, that can find   certain diseases or cells in the body. You know, \nI do not have a background in biotech at all,   but I would almost guarantee somebody's trying to \nfigure out how to get tiny robots that can find   and kill cancer in people.\nVanessa:  That sounds great.\nDan:  That would be probably the best \nuse of an electronic gadget.  Vanessa:\nMine is very selfish compared to that.  Dan:\nYeah because nothing sucks more than cancer, I \nthink. This is just the worst thing.  Vanessa:\nYeah. Well, if you are in biotech or if you are   a cancer related doctor or surgeon-\nDan:  Send me your number and I'll tell you my plans.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Let us know. Does something like this \nexists? Is this something that's in the works?   Yeah. Never know.\nDan:  Yeah. How about you? How many cancer destroying \nthings are you creating in your spare time?  Vanessa:\nOh, sorry. Mine's very selfish.   I was thinking more personal. In our house, to \ngo to our deck, we have a sliding door. There's   a glass sliding door, and then there's a screen \nthat you can just push through. It's a magnet,   you can just go through it. But in the summer, we \ntry to keep the glass sliding door closed because   there's air conditioning in our house and it's \nsuper hot and muggy, humid outside, so we don't   want that air to get inside. We want it to stay \ncool inside. We go in and out a lot in our house.   With young children, it's kind of tricky \nto get them to keep that glass door closed.   It's also kind of heavy.\nDan:  The sliding door.\nVanessa:  Yeah, for them to pull it open is okay, and then \nthey bust through the screen door and they're   outside like, \"I'm going to go do something,\" \nand they don't think about the glass door.   And for me too, sometimes if I'm carrying \nsomething, I have to open the door.   My electronic gadget would be a button \nthat you can push that would open the door,   and then automatically within 30 seconds, it would \nclose the door, so you have time to go through   and it would close. It might be sensor \nby your body, so if you're still   in the doorway it wouldn't close, but \nthat way it would always close behind us.  Dan:\nCouldn't you just use in the grocery   store where it automatically opens?\nVanessa:  Yeah, something like that.\nDan:  A sliding automatic door.\nVanessa:  But people don't have that in their house.\nDan:  Oh. But it's only a matter of money.\nVanessa:  I mean, maybe we could get something \nlike that installed in our house now,   but I was kind of envisioning, I imagine people \nwho are handicapped or in a wheelchair, maybe they   have something like this that's automatic.\nDan:  Probably.\nVanessa:  I'm sure it's a big system you have to install. \nIt's probably a lot of money or kind of a hassle,   but I'm sure there's some kind of system.\nDan:  Well, we could go to a closed down grocery \nstore, and every time it opens, it says,   \"Welcome to Aldi.\"\nVanessa:  As in we would take Aldi's doors?\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  And put them in our house, and it would have a \nspeaker that says, \"Welcome to the grocery store,\"   every time we open our house's doors?\nDan:  It'd be the most charming thing \nwe could possibly add to our home.  Vanessa:\nMaybe we could have it say,   \"Welcome home, Vanessa.\"\nDan:  Oh, yeah. Programmable.\nVanessa:  I don't think I would like my doors to talk.\nDan:  And it also takes off your hat.  Vanessa:\nWow.  Dan:\nWith an arm.  Vanessa:\nMaybe it also feeds you food and gives you water.  Dan:\nAnd it's a conveyor belt too,   so you don't have to walk through it.\nVanessa:  And maybe it is also your brain, \nso you don't have to think.  Dan:\nAnd there's another arm that   puts a soda in your hand.\nVanessa:  That's weird. Yes. I would like our glass sliding \ndoor to be closed more easily so that it is not a   personal hassle or an annoyance in our home. But \nI must say that Dan's cancer fighting robots are   probably a better idea. Anyway, I thought \nabout this question for about 4.2 seconds.  Dan:\nAnd I thought of it for four minutes.  Vanessa:\nOkay.  Dan:\nTo be fair.  Vanessa:\nYeah. So,   maybe if I thought about it for four minutes \nI would've come up with a better idea. Anyway,   what about you? What kind of new electronic gadget \nwould you like to invent, and what would it do?   Let us know in the comments and we'll go to our \nnext question. Question number 11 is about money.   I'd like to know what is something that you \ncan justify spending more money on and why?  Dan:\nYeah. Justify. I mean, probably speakers.  Vanessa:\nWe always talk about speakers.  Dan:\nI'm kidding. I like audio stuff a lot.   I would say maybe once a year I just start \nlooking into some audio equipment or some kind   of electronics, usually. I'm like, \"Vanessa, do \nyou think we could?\" She's like, \"No, we have 10   speakers,\" or headphones or something. You know?\nVanessa:  We talked about this in past videos.\nDan:  Yes. This is not actually \nmy answer. I said property.  Vanessa:\nOh okay. Dan:\nYeah, because I know for sure   we want to have another property.\nVanessa:  Like in the woods?\nDan:  Yes. We would like to own, it might \njust be land, but maybe just a cabin.   This is a little bit nostalgic for me because \nmy grandfather actually gave my parents   or I guess gave us access to a very simple cabin \nthat we would go to in the mountains in Colorado,   and that was our little escape \nfrom the hubbub of normal life   going to that cabin.\nVanessa:  No electricity, no plumbing.\nDan:  Yes, but it has to be like that. It has to be \noff grid, basically. I mean, it had electricity.  Vanessa:\nOh yeah. Dan:\nBut it didn't   have running water.\nVanessa:  Ah, that was a thing.\nDan:  I mean, I think I'd take \nelectricity. That's kind of nice.  Vanessa:\nThat is nice.  Dan:\nI don't know. We'll debate the details later, but   I know for sure I want to have some more property. \nYou can always justify it by saying, \"Well,   this is an investment too. You can always resell \nit.\" Usually with property you'll at least make   back what you bought it for.\nVanessa:  Hopefully.\nDan:  Especially in this area, it's always growing,   so I can make a lot of justifications for \nwhy we need to own many beach homes. I mean-  Vanessa:\nMountain-  Dan:\n... mountain homes.  Vanessa:\n... cabins. Yeah. When you were a kid-  Dan:\nMany.  Vanessa:\n... you would   just go to the mountains with your mom \nand siblings and play in the woods and   catch critters.\nDan:  Yeah. There was acres of land there. There wasn't \nas many critters as I would've liked there.  Vanessa:\nOh yeah. Dan:\nBut there was a pond and there   were dragon flies and fish.\nVanessa:  Oh, that sounds fun.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  I think that's a beautiful childhood too, being \nable to do stuff like that. We go hiking a lot,   but there's something special about staying there.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  In the cabin and you go back to the same place, \nmaybe different seasons, and get to know the   seasons there.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  That's cool.\nDan:  Yeah. The best thing about the cabin that we \nhad was it had a loft. It doesn't seem very safe   thinking back to it, because my memory of it is it \nwas like a plywood deck hanging from the ceiling.  Vanessa:\nDid it have a-  Dan:\nIt was hanging down, and you climbed a ladder up   to it. It had plywood walls, but there were gaps \nin the walls too, where you could just jump down,   which we didn't jump down. But what we did was \nbecause it was a one room cabin, if my parents   were there with some friends or my grandparents, \nthey would play cards, and they would send us to   bed, but we could hear everything, so we'd spy on \nthem and we'd drop stuff down on them and stuff.  Vanessa:\nThat sounds fun.  Dan:\nYeah. That was fun.  Vanessa:\nWow, so maybe we can recreate this   rustic experience.\nDan:  We need a loft.\nVanessa:  Do you think it would be just as fun as \nan adult? Because you were a kid doing it,   do you think that-\nDan:  To sleep in the loft?\nVanessa:  Well, for us, because we're adults now, so \nhaving this rural experience, would it be as   fun for us as it would-\nDan:  I think it would be.\nVanessa:  ... as for kids?\nDan:  Yeah, because one benefit of being in a place like   America and the United States is that you can \nusually find some place that is very rural   and quiet.\nVanessa:  Quickly and close.\nDan:  We live close enough to a highway \nand stuff that it would be nice to   just only hear the birds chirping.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I think that's really possible. I mean-\nDan:  And get away from electronics and stuff. It would \nhave to be an intentional, this is not a place   where we have a TV, for example.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I think you can drive about 20 minutes away \nfrom our house and be very much in the woods.  Dan:\nYes.  Vanessa:\nBut anyway, that's a   specific discussion for another time.\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  Cool. So, you'd like to have-\nDan:  More property.\nVanessa:  ... a cabin, and that would be a investment, \nan investment that you could justify.   Well, I think for me, when I thought about this, \nI thought more of something that we already do   that we have justified spending more money on, so-\nDan:  Garden boxes.\nVanessa:  I spend too much money on the garden. That's true.   These are the world's most expensive tomatoes.\nDan:  We are now a small scale farm.\nVanessa:  That's not what I was saying, but that \nis true. I thought of something more   in our daily life. I think this is different for \neveryone depending on how much money you have. At   some point in our marriage, we bought the cheapest \nfood. This is all that we could afford and   that was it. But then as we made more money, we \nwanted to intentionally buy better quality food.  Dan:\nWe prioritize it.  Vanessa:\nYeah. So, instead   of just buying expensive food, we wanted to buy, \nespecially we kind of made an intention to buy   better quality animal products specifically. In \nthe US, you have a lot of options. You could buy   organic carrots or conventional carrots, and \nnot so much that I'm thinking more about meat   and yogurt and cheese and milk-\nDan:  Where the creatures are involved.\nVanessa:  Yeah, because in the area where we live, \nthere's a lot of options for buying   local grass fed beef, for example, where \nthere's a farm down the street and it's   much more expensive than buying the cheapest \nbeef at the grocery store. But for us,   as we've made more money, this has been \nsomething that we justify spending more money on.   If we didn't have money, then I would not spend \nmoney on that, because that wasn't a priority.  Dan:\nIt would be hot dogs and canned tuna.  Vanessa:\nI mean, maybe not hot dogs, but some beans   or just rice, something very simple.\nDan:  Rice and beans. There you go.\nVanessa:  Yeah. You can live off of that. Lots of people \ndo. But for us, this has been something that   we have been intentional about. \nWhen we buy milk, we try to buy   good quality, not just expensive, but either \nlocal milk or something that's whole milk,   grass fed, something local, these types of things. \nWe have our own chickens, so those are certainly-  Dan:\nThey're free range.  Vanessa:\nBeautiful quality eggs. But this   type of thing, because I feel like it is directly \nimpacting the farming world and the animal's life.   We are not vegan, we are not vegetarian, \nbut I don't like conventional farms and   factory farms, big scale farms.\nDan:  From the standpoint of the animals?\nVanessa:  From a lot of standpoints, the environment, \nanimals, all of that, maybe you're eating   too much meat, but I completely understand that \nif you don't have much money, you buy food. You   just have to buy the food that you buy and you \nhave to survive. Then as you make more money,   you make different choices about what you buy. \nFor us, that's been increasing the quality of   the animal products that we buy for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. But anyway, that's something   that I can justify spending more money on.\nDan:  Yes. Better food.\nVanessa:  Yeah. That's something that we've chosen to \nspend more money on over time. That is probably   different for you. Let us know in the comments \nfor you, what is something that you can justify   spending more money on, maybe in the future, like \nDan's answer, some cabin or property, you could   justify spending more money on that, or maybe it's \nsomething that you already spend more money on,   like my answer. Let us know in the comments. \nI'm curious. What are your financial priorities?   Let us know in the comments, and let's go to the \nnext question. Question number 11 is about games.   We like games.\nDan:  Games. Are they fun?\nVanessa:  Yes.\nDan:  I don't know.\nVanessa:  I would like to know what is a game that you \nplay that you're very competitive about. The   word competitive means you want to win. \nYou feel serious, you can still have fun,   but you want to win.\nDan:  The real question for me is what is a \ngame that I don't feel competitive about,   because I have a game switch in my head. I \nstart playing a game and I'm like, \"Strategy on,   let's win this thing,\" and I feel very competitive \nabout it. I would say, especially any game that   has strategy where you can actually make \ndecisions that will really impact the game,   there's a lot of games that are just roll the dice \nand it's random chance. It's a little easier not   to be competitive about that.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  Like when I played shoots and ladders \nwith my son the other day, 100% luck,   which he didn't necessarily understand. He was \nlike, \"Look, I'm going to jump over the slide.\"  Vanessa:\nYou can't jump over the slide.  Dan:\nThat's not part of the rules.   But that was very interesting that he \nthought about that himself. But anyway, yeah,   the question is, what am I competitive-\nVanessa:  Yeah. Give an example of some games, \nbecause maybe our students too would like-  Dan:\nWhat am I super competitive about?  Vanessa:\nYeah. Maybe they'd like some   examples that they could play.\nDan:  A recent example is there's a game called \nCode Names, and it's one of the best games   ever, I think.\nVanessa:  Actually, I have a YouTube video where Dan and I \nplay this and I teach you how to play it and teach   you vocabulary along the way.\nDan:  Is very challenging, it scales, \nso if your group is very smart,   they'll play it very smart. If your group is \ndumb, it plays to the level of the players.   I've had to train myself not to get competitive \nabout this game, because for example, we first   played this. We literally went to bed \nthat night and had an argument about it.  Vanessa:\n\"But why did you say this thing?\" No,   I meant that.\" \"How could you not get this?\"\nDan:  Yeah. It feels really bad \nto lose that game, I think.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nSo, that one really got to me.   The last time we played, I have to usually tell \nmyself I'm not going to get super competitive.   I'm just going to have a good time, and if I \nlose, that's okay. I have to prep myself because   I really like to win games.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Yeah.\nDan:  Actually, I've gotten better with that over time.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I think Code Names is a good \none for English learners. One that   we play often or we play maybe three \ntimes a year is Settlers of Catan.  Dan:\nYes.  Vanessa:\nYou can play the simple version of sellers   of Catan, or you can use the expansions.\nDan:  We go a little crazy.\nVanessa:  The original game, it might take one and a half \nhours, but the way we play, sometimes it takes   five hours, and it can be very intense. It depends \non who you play with. I've played this game with   people who are so serious that they are not fun \nto play with, as in if you set the dice down,   they'll say, \"Oh, your turn's over. It's my \nturn now.\" \"What? Give me some slack. Cut   me some slack.\" But when we play with us, and \nthe people we usually play with is Dan's sister   and her husband, Brad-\nDan:  That's the only people we play with now.\nVanessa:  Dan rock climbed with, yeah, when we play with \nthem, we're all competitive, but we're nice.  Dan:\nWe're lighthearted at the same time.  Vanessa:\nYeah. We have a good   time still. Sometimes at the end of the game, \nwhen it's about two o'clock in the morning-  Dan:\nWe've gad arguments though.  Vanessa:\nOkay. We've had big   arguments, the four of us about it. But \nwhen it's getting really late at night,   everyone's really tired, and we know we have to \nwake up early with all of our kids, so it gets a   little more stressful. But that's a fun one.\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  Those are neither-\nDan:  You feel competitive about that?\nVanessa:  I feel competitive about-\nDan:  You're a quiet competitor.\nVanessa:  I feel competitive about those games, but I \nfeel most competitive when I play Carcassonne.  Dan:\nOh,   just against me?\nVanessa:  Against you, mainly because-\nDan:  You beat me a lot too.\nVanessa:  That's why.\nDan:  I don't like it.\nVanessa:  Because I have probably a 50% chance of winning.   A lot of games, depending on what they are, if I \nplay them with just Dan, I either won't win often   or it'll be like 30% of the time I'll win. But \nwith Carcassonne, I win about 50% of the time.  Dan:\nIt's not just luck.  Vanessa:\nIt's not just luck. There's a lot of   work and strategy. If you miss up a move, you \ncan lose the entire game, and your three hour   experience is lost. I like Carcassonne a lot \nbecause of that. It's fun to me, I can win.  Dan:\nWe can play one on one.  Vanessa:\nWe can play just us,   and I think that's a good... there's not many-\nVanessa:  Play just us, and I think that's a good ... \nThere's not many good strategy games that you   can play with just two people. It's based off of \na city in France, Carcassonne, the same name. And   the game looks like that city.\nDan:  You build city walls and roads and stuff.\nVanessa:  Yeah. It's quite fun. There's \nalso expansions on that.   That can make it longer.\nDan:  Theo would love that game.\nVanessa:  I think he could play it.\nDan:  Yeah. We got to play that with my son.\nVanessa:  Yeah. That'd be fun. Anyway.\nDan:  He's going to like games too. We're \ngoing to get in a lot of family arguments  Vanessa:\nAbout being competitive. Actually. He played   Settlers of CATAN Jr.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  Which is the kid's version.\nDan:  He did amazing. Yesterday.\nVanessa:  Yesterday, for the first time \nand you were playing with him.  Dan:\nI helped him a lot, but he still got it.  Vanessa:\nCool. That's a new   phase in parenting. When we can-\nDan:  He's not even five yet and he still sat through \nturns and listened to the rules and he looked at   the little chart and figured it out and stuff.\nVanessa:  That's cool.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  That sounds fun. I would-\nDan:  It was impressive.\nVanessa:  I like little kid stuff, but I really like-\nDan:  Big kid stuff.\nVanessa:  ... playing baseball with your kids or playing \nSettlers of CATAN with your kids. Stuff that I   enjoy too. Like for example, we're going to an \naquarium for our five year old's birthday. I like   aquariums and this isn't something that's just for \nkids. It's for us too. And it's for his birthday.   So a new stage of the ...\nDan:  The giant critter museum.\nVanessa:  That's Dan's favorite.\nDan:  Yes.\nVanessa:  Anyway, that was a little detour. So I want to \nknow for you, what game do you feel competitive   about? Or maybe you are a non-competitive \nperson. You play a game and you're like,   \"I can win. I don't have to win. It's okay.\" Or \nmaybe you are super competitive. Let us know in   the comments what's a game you feel competitive \nabout and we'll go to our next question. Question.   Number 13 is about celebrities or maybe they \ndon't have to be celebrities. Interesting people.  Dan:\nFamous people.  Vanessa:\nThis is a common-  Dan:\nInfamous people.  Vanessa:\n... question, common conversation question   to spice things up. I'm having a special \ndinner party. Who is someone dead or alive   who you would like to invite?\nDan:  Yeah, I feel like I've answered \nsomething similar to this recently.  Vanessa:\nOh okay. Dan:\nAnd I give this answer a lot,   so I'm very current. I just want to know \nwhat's going on in the world now. So I would   just invite the current president. Okay. So Joe \nBiden, I would actually take Donald Trump too,   just because I can't believe these people exist \nand are so annoying and dumb. I want to see what   they're really like. Are they really as ridiculous \nand empty as they seem? Are they faking it? I want   to ask them tough questions and see if Joe Biden \njust falls asleep in the middle of dinner, or if   Donald Trump just ... I guess he seems pretty ... \nYeah. He'd probably just blow if he ate something.   But yeah, I want to get into their heads or try \nto, and just see how ridiculous they are in real   life. Because again-\nVanessa:  You're just curious.\nDan:  I live my life and then I see these are the people \nrunning the country and I just can't put that   together and it makes me feel upset usually.\nVanessa:  They don't seem like real people.\nDan:  Yeah. They're not.\nVanessa:  So having a dinner conversation with somebody can \nbring out the real them, the real inside look.  Dan:\nSure. Oh yeah. That's another key   element. I'd get them really drunk.\nVanessa:  Okay.\nDan:  Got to spike their drinks a little bit \nmore. And this is not what I'd really do,   but this is the hypothetical world where I get \nDonald Trump at my dinner table or Joe Biden.  Vanessa:\nOkay.  Dan:\nJoe Biden would just fall asleep. I'm   convinced. He's old and just not with it.\nVanessa:  Okay. Well.\nDan:  But he'd probably share a lot of \ninformation if you got them tipsy.  Vanessa:\nThat would be very interesting.  Dan:\nYeah. Just how close are your fingers   to the nuclear buttons, Mr. President?\nVanessa:  Do we want to know?\nDan:  No.\nVanessa:  Well, I feel like for my answer to this \nquestion, I chose to go much more personal.   And that's usually when I think \nabout this question, I always   think that more.\nDan:  This is the difference between you and me.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Because if I met with the \ncurrent or past presidents of the US,   I don't know what I would do with that \ninformation. Okay, so this is what they're   like now, what do I do?\nDan:  Share it to the world.\nVanessa:  But I think-\nDan:  Nobody'd believe you.\nVanessa:  I would be very interested from a personal \nstandpoint to meet, on my question number one I   mentioned Antoinette Menifee, my great grandma who \ncame from Italy. I would be very interested to sit   down and have a conversation at dinner with her.\nDan:  That would be very interesting.\nVanessa:  What kind of woman is she \nthat she met a random man,   moved to another country, left her family, \nnever saw them again and raised six children in   the US? And here we are.\nDan:  I have a question.\nVanessa:  I'd be very interested.\nDan:  Would you go back in time or would she come \nto current time in this hypothetical universe?  Vanessa:\nShe would come to current times.  Dan:\nSo you want to show her the future?  Vanessa:\nI wouldn't show her   anything. I would just be eating dinner with her \nand she would have her entire life experience.   Okay. So I don't want her to be like, so \nmaybe it doesn't matter 90 years old when she   can't remember things, but I don't want her \nto be 30 years old and she hasn't had a lot of   experiences yet. So this is a magical question.\nDan:  60?\nVanessa:  I don't know.\nDan:  How long did she live, anyways?\nVanessa:  I don't know. I met her when I-\nDan:  You did?\nVanessa:  There's a picture of me on her lap as a baby.\nDan:  Oh.\nVanessa:  So she lived at least till like 1987, \n1988. I don't know how old she was,   but I'm sure she was-\nDan:  She was probably pretty old.\nVanessa:  She had a lot of life experiences and I'm always \ncurious about what life was like back then. And   I think it would be a personal touch to be \nlike, \"Oh, this was someone who is part of me   and some roots.\" Anyway, that's \nmy answer. So I'm curious for you,   if you had a magical dinner party, who would you \nlike to invite someone dead or alive? Let us know   in the comments. I'm curious to see what you \nhave to say and let's go to our next question.  Vanessa:\nThe 14th question is about   pets. What kind of pet would you like to have?\nDan:  What kind of pet? If I could have any pets.\nVanessa:  If you could have any pet.\nDan:  In the world.\nVanessa:  Yes.\nDan:  That I don't already have.\nVanessa:  Well, we have chickens.\nDan:  We have cats and chickens.\nVanessa:  Tadpoles that turned into frogs, cats. \nDo we have anything else at the moment?  Dan:\nWell okay. I can think of one ...\nVanessa:  A caterpillar.\nDan:  ... that does not really fit our family.\nVanessa:  Okay.\nDan:  And it is a smart dog that doesn't bark too much.\nVanessa:  Our child hates barking dogs.\nDan:  Well, I hate barking too.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  But I really like dogs to a degree. Certain dogs \nI really like, because I just feel like humans and   dogs, they really are man's best friend. But when \nI think about how much work a dog takes and it's   like almost taking on another family member.\nVanessa:  Oh yeah.\nDan:  And it just doesn't really fit. Not to mention   our oldest son is extremely afraid of dogs.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  And he really, really does not like them.\nVanessa:  Yeah. If you have any tips about how to help \nkids feel more comfortable with dogs without   traumatizing them, I need some help.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  Let me know in the comments.\nDan:  We're working on. It. It's a work in progress.\nVanessa:  Yep.\nDan:  But also, I don't think you \nlike dogs as much as I do.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nI don't think you would put   it on a bucket list. It's almost a bucket list \nthing for me to have a dog someday. A cool dog,   like a Border Collie or an Australian Shepherd. \nSomething that's noble, smart, fast, cunning and   difficult to keep. Because border collies are \nnotorious for needing lots and lots of exercise.  Vanessa:\nYeah. If we were farmers,   maybe. We worked on a farm.\nDan:  We're getting there.\nVanessa:  But we have a big garden. We worked on a farm in \nthe south of France and they had a Border Collie   that was so fun and so smart.\nDan:  You could see the intelligence in that dog's eyes.\nVanessa:  Oh yeah. That dog was amazing. But that \ndog was living in the perfect place. It had   endless stimulation, endless exercise.\nDan:  Never went inside.\nVanessa:  That dog could work there. Yeah. It was great. \nBut I think it's also smart to know what animals   don't fit your life. And for us, at least \nat the moment, we have a lot of smart, fast   running around creatures in our house \ncalled children. So we're at our capacity.  Dan:\nYes. Yeah. And there's also more   dogs that I actually dislike than like. There's \na lot of dogs I'm just like, \"No, thank you.\"   Small yippy dogs, no. No, thanks. No.\nVanessa:  It's not your style.\nDan:  Not my thing.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  It'd need to be bigger, smarter, noble, cunning. \nThese are the words that come to my mind when I   think of a cool dog.\nVanessa:  Okay, yeah. A dog that helps you in \nsome way too. A working dog, maybe.  Dan:\nSure. That's not even necessary.   Just one that can catch a Frisbee.\nVanessa:  Oh, that sounds fun. Cool. Well, \nour kids are getting there.   Did you have another one? I thought \nyou said you had a second one.  Dan:\nOh, well, so I also said some fish.  Vanessa:\nOh.  Dan:\nLike a giant fish.  Vanessa:\nWhat's giant mean?  Dan:\nThis is-  Vanessa:\nLike a whale?  Dan:\nBoth of these are unrealistic.   Because you said any pet.\nVanessa:  Yeah. It's okay. We can dream.\nDan:  When you get into the aquarium world. Let me \ntell you about the aquarium world. You can get   pretty detailed and intense about it. And there \nare some really cool fish. There's one, I think   it's called a arowana.\nVanessa:  Okay.\nDan:  I want to say, and they can get like this big.\nVanessa:  What kind of tank do you have to have?\nDan:  They're shiny and they can be gold or red, \nbut they'll literally sell for $10,000.  Vanessa:\nWhat? And you probably have to   have a tank the size of this room.\nDan:  And you need a big tank. Probably \nnot the size of the room.  Vanessa:\nOh my goodness.  Dan:\nI wouldn't want to spend money on it.   I'd never bring myself to spend money on it.\nVanessa:  You can't justify spending money on it.\nDan:  If somebody just gave me the supplies \nand the fish, I'd set it up and be happy.  Vanessa:\nOkay. That's a good dream. Yeah. Like my dream.  Dan:\nYeah. How about you?  Vanessa:\nI said-  Dan:\nA dinosaur.  Vanessa:\nNo, I said a cow.  Dan:\nOh.  Vanessa:\nYeah. I think it would be cool to have a cow, but-  Dan:\nDaisy.  Vanessa:\nThe only way I would have a cow is if basically   I was just the owner and someone else came every \nday to milk the cow. Somebody prepared, took care   of the cow. I don't want to take care of it.\nDan:  And in this scenario you're a noble woman.\nVanessa:  Yes.\nDan:  Living in her manor.\nVanessa:  Yes. And I would say, \"Go take care of my cow \ndown there.\" Basically. I just want lots of milk.   Lots of milk-\nDan:  Free milk.\nVanessa:  ... to make ... It's not free. \nThere's a lot of work into a cow.  Dan:\nOkay. Not so free.  Vanessa:\nI have to pay the person   who takes care of the cow.\nDan:  You're not touching udders.\nVanessa:  Having endless amounts of yogurt, cheese, milk, \nthat's from your fresh dairy cow. That's cool.   But it's also extremely hard.\nDan:  They poop all over your yard.\nVanessa:  Well, I don't even need to keep it in my yard.\nDan:  So do the chickens. Oh.\nVanessa:  It would be on my farm.  Dan:\nOh.  Vanessa:\nIt would be   in someone else's farm and \nI would just own that cow.  Dan:\nOn your manor.  Vanessa:\nBut there's actually,   I was thinking about this the other day, we stayed \nat an Airbnb that was a farm and they have some   cows and horses and chickens and they have a milk \nsharing program where you can buy part of the cow.   So you're not actually like I buy the leg of the \ncow, that kind of thing. They're saying, if you   buy part of the cow, the ownership of this \ncow, you will get a certain amount of milk   per month from that cow. \nSo it's what I'm thinking.   You don't have to do any work, but you get the \nmilk. Yeah. And you pay for it. But it's local   and it's going back to justifying, spending \nmore money on high quality animal products.  Dan:\nWe could just do that.  Vanessa:\nWe eat a lot of yogurt and I hate   to buy all the yogurt. We buy a bulk big yogurt \ncontainer, but we go through so many of those.   We eat yogurt a lot. Our kids eat yogurt a lot.\nDan:  Our kids love yogurt.\nVanessa:  Yeah. I think that if we had something \nlike a milk sharing program, we would,   or I would be more inclined to just make some \nyogurt in the Crockpot or something and have   that at home. Anyway.\nDan:  That's a very Vanessa answer.\nVanessa:  That's a dream.\nDan:  A cow that you don't want to take care of.\nVanessa:  No, I don't want to take care of it.\nDan:  Those people that had the cow at the \nAirbnb, they looked really tired.  Vanessa:\nThey said-  Dan:\nThey had three cows,   two cows?\nVanessa:  They said the word we would use to describe having \na cow is relentless. They said rain or shine,   sick or not.\nDan:  You got to milk them.\nVanessa:  Christmas or Thanksgiving, any day, twice a day, \nthey have to go to the barn and milk that cow.  Dan:\nYeah. And it's just two people there.  Vanessa:\nYeah. They didn't hire anyone to   help them, so they never get a vacation, which \nthey could hire someone to help occasionally.  Dan:\nI will just say-  Vanessa:\nAnyway. Not my style.  Dan:\nI saw a twinge of regret in her eyes   when she was talking about this decision.\nVanessa:  Yeah. They loved those cows and they took \ngood care of them. But they're like, \"Oh,   this is relentless.\"\nDan:  Yeah. Because in their previous life, they \nweren't ... Well life. Jobs or careers,   they weren't farmers at all.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  They made a conscious decision to go back to   farming.\nVanessa:  Yeah. Anyway, that's my answer, a cow.\nDan:  That could be you.\nVanessa:  That could be me. We'll see. \nAnyway, what about you? What pet,   if you could have any pet in the world, or any \nanimal really, it doesn't even have to be a pet,   what would you have? Let us know in the comments. \nAnd we'll go to our final question. Are you ready?  Dan:\nReady.  Vanessa:\nLet's go. The final question. Question number 15.   We've made it this far is about books. \nSomething that's a love of my life. The   question is-\nDan:  And not as much mine.\nVanessa:  Yeah, so I'm very curious what \nyou have to say about this.   What is a book that you would recommend \neveryone read because you loved it so much?  Dan:\nYeah. My answer's definitely a cop out here.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nBecause I don't read that much. And   the most I ever read, we had a book club and it \nbasically required me to read. And I like reading   a lot. I just don't do it. I find myself listening \nto something or watching something first.   So my cop out answer is some parenting book.\nVanessa:  Oh okay.\nDan: So the one that comes to my mind is called \nPeaceful Parenting, but I don't think it   specifically has to be that. It just has to be \nsomething that is not too modern, but not just   handed down generationally, like, \"I just do what \nmy parents did.\" Something intentional, training   people basically how to be better, kinder, gentler \nparents for their children. How to talk to them   better. There's a lot of strategies and tips you \ncan get for talking about or talking to children.   And the book also needs to have like a lot \nof what's that child psychology informing it   scientifically because the more you learn about \nchildren, the more you learn that they are   developing at different times and rates and \nyou might think they can handle something,   but in reality, their brains literally can't \nhandle it. So that gives you more patience.  Vanessa:\nYeah.  Dan:\nBecause there's a lot of people,   a lot of parents who just think their kids are \nstubborn or just want to yell at them for things,   but they don't really get the full picture \nabout the child's development and their needs.  Vanessa:\nYeah. Yeah.  Dan:\nSo that's my answer even though   it's not really one specific book.\nVanessa:  Don't worry.\nDan:  I have other books that I really enjoyed, but \nmaybe aren't as relevant to people. One that came   to my mind is called Educated.\nVanessa:  Oh, that was an interesting book. Yeah.\nDan:  But that feels really relevant to me because I was \nhomeschooled. And so this girl was homeschooled,   but in a really bad environment. And so it's that \nstory basically of being extremely sheltered. And   basically even in that terrible environment, \nthere's almost pros and cons to it.   It almost made her stronger in some \nways, even though it was awful.  Vanessa:\nThat's an interesting story.  Dan:\nThat was a very interesting book to me.  Vanessa:\nYeah. I would say for the parenting books,   I have an Amazon link.\nDan:  She's got a list for you.\nVanessa:  I do. It's a Speak English With Vanessa Amazon \nbook storefront. So I've chosen a bunch of books   that I recommend because I've made a lot of videos \nabout books on this channel. So in the description   of this video, you can see the Amazon link for \nmy book recommendations and there's different   folders. There's children's books, there's \nbeginner English books. If you've never read   a book in English before, this is what I recommend \nreading there's intermediate books, there's   nonfiction books.\nVanessa:  And in that children's book section are books for \nchildren, but also parenting book recommendations   that have really impacted us and have been \nuseful in our lives. For example, a book called   Hunt, Gather, Parent. There's another book \ncalled Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids. And if you   have more than one child Peaceful Parent, Happy \nSiblings is amazing. We've read a lot of these   styles of books. And I think it's just changing \nyour mindset about how to respect your child,   but also still be the authority.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  Anyway, like Dan said-\nDan:  It's a tough balance.\nVanessa:  ... some psychology as well. So there's a \nlot of recommendations. If you click on that   Amazon link and you would like to dive into the \nworld of a better relationship with your child,  Dan:\nEspecially if you got kids out there.  Vanessa:\nOh yeah. Or you are interacting with children.   Anyway, it's very insightful. My recommendation \nwas also on a similar nonfiction route. Because   I've read a lot of fiction that's personally \nmade me feel passionate about different topics.   And I love reading fiction and diving into \ndifferent worlds, especially historical   fiction where you're learning about something in \nhistory. But I would say the book that made me   within the last two years, the \nmost passionate, can you guess?  Dan:\nSomething about Native Americans?  Vanessa:\nNo, I do read a lot about native Americans   though. Is a book called Digital Minimalism.\nDan:  Oh yeah. I thought you were talking fiction.\nVanessa:  Yes. Which is-\nDan:  Or nonfiction.\nVanessa:  Oh, this one is not fiction.\nDan:  This is nonfiction.\nVanessa:  It's ironic because we are here \nsharing this on social media.  Dan:\nYeah.  Vanessa:\nBut if you feel like you   look at your phone too much, or if you feel like, \n\"Why did it seem like life was so much more simple   in the 1990s?\"\nDan:  It was.\nVanessa:  This is a wonderful book to read, Digital \nMinimalism. It confirmed everything that I   suspected or that I thought about, especially \nabout phones, but about media in general.  Dan:\nTechnology.  Vanessa:\nBut it gave a better   plan for what to do because you can't just \ncut out YouTube from your life. I need-  Dan:\nI don't know about that.  Vanessa:\nYou can't cut out Vanessa's videos. When I need   to, for example, do something with the garden, \nwhat do I do when I don't know? I Google it. I   watch a YouTube video. It's very useful in many \nways, say for education or even for entertainment,   but this book helps you to have a good plan so \nthat you are the one in control of your media use.   It's not just social media. It could be watching \nthe news all the time. It could be listening to   podcasts all the time, whatever it is. I feel \nlike this book helped me to create a better   plan for myself so that I felt more in control. \nSo I highly recommend this book because I feel   like it's ubiquitous that everyone, especially if \nyou're watching this on YouTube in some way ...  Dan:\nStruggles.  Vanessa:\n... uses technology more than they would like.  Dan:\nYeah.  Vanessa:\nAnd technology's not a bad thing.  Dan:\nIt's a modern problem.  Vanessa:\nYeah. It's just something that can easily   get out of hand, which is a great expression.\nDan:  So do you have any fiction books though?\nVanessa:  Oh yes. But that is ...\nDan:  Recommendations?\nVanessa:  ... a whole nother rabbit hole.\nDan:  Yeah.\nVanessa:  I would recommend if you want to read-\nDan:  We didn't mention fiction.\nVanessa:  Yeah.\nDan:  You got to say one thing at least.\nVanessa:  Well, I do recommend watching my videos \nabout fiction book recommendations.  Dan:\nShe's got a whole video   about it right here.\nVanessa:  I have four videos.\nDan:  Or is it here?\nVanessa:  Three videos I think so far about book \nrecommendations. If you would like to   watch my video about books to learn about \nAmerica. So they're American books about American   culture or they're books that are popular \nabout the US. There's books I mentioned about   beginner English books. If you've never read a \nbook in English before I made a video about those.   Nonfiction books, I think I did an advanced \nbook video as well. There are a lot. So I   will put those links in the description. Please \ndive into that if you're interested in reading.   It's something I'm passionate about, so \nI'm always happy to share more about it.   And I'm glad this last question was something \nthat is so exciting for me. Yes. Well,   thank you so much everyone for \njoining us today for this very,   very long conversation.\nDan:  Yes. We hope you enjoyed it.\nVanessa:  Yes. I hope that you enjoyed it. I hope that you \ncan dive into it a little bit deeper if you would   like to download the free MP3. I mean not MP3, \nPDF. It's been a long morning making this video.   If you would like to download the free PDF \nworksheet for this video, there is a link in   the description.

We'll expand. I'll be explaining-\nDan:  Dive into our ramblings.\nVanessa:  Yes. Explaining some of the key expressions that \nwe talked about in this video. Not all of them,   but the ones that I deem the most important. \nSo stay tuned next week. You can download the   PDF today and then join me next week to dive into \nthe vocabulary a little deeper.

What is the meaning of life?  Dan:\nI think we did as best we could.  Vanessa:\nIf you made it to the end of this video,   I would like to give you a little ...\nDan:  High five.\nVanessa:  A high five, and also a little surprise.\nDan:  Oh.\nVanessa:  If you made it to the end of this video \nin the comments, I want you to write   blue water bottle. And when I see that in the \ncomments, I'll know you finished this video   because you wrote blue water bottle.\nDan:  You saw the blue water bottle.\nVanessa:  Oh, it's here. Okay. Well that's our little \nsecret nugget at the end of this video. Thank   you so much for joining us. And I will see you \nagain next Friday for a new lesson here on my   YouTube channel.
